<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Neuromodulation Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Internal Treatment</li><li>External Treatment</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The neuromodulation market is divided into two main types: internal and external treatments. Internal treatments involve implanted devices, such as deep brain stimulators or spinal cord stimulators, delivering targeted stimulation directly to the nervous system to alter its activity. In contrast, external treatments utilize non-invasive methods, such as transcranial magnetic stimulation or peripheral nerve stimulation, which interact with the nervous system from outside the body. Both approaches aim to manage chronic pain, neurological disorders, and other medical conditions.</p></p>
